Implementations:

Dot Product: I used a dot product function to determine whether or not the player was in front of a spider object.

Linear Interpolation: If the dot product function determined that the player was in front of the spider, then I used Linear Interpolation (Lerp) to make the spider "jump" at the player.

Particle Effect: I used a downloaded explosion asset and then created a trigger that when the player passed through the final checkpoint, it activated the explosion.

Sound Effect: I attached the sound effect to the particle effect by downloading a free explosion sound and then attaching it to the explosion asset.
